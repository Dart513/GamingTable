# GamingTable

As part of TEJ4M1, [Collin Town](https://github.com/towner-10) and I worked on making a gaming table. The purpose of this repository is to document our progress.
We were interrupted by a stay-at-home order during the pandemic, so we were unable to complete the physical gaming table.


The gaming table would have used GPIO buttons and analog inputs to control games run on a Raspberry Pi running Retropie. As well, we would have had several self-made games, such as the [reaction time game](tbd).


## Parts:
- [RetroPie Settings](tbd)
- [GPIO To EmulationStation Input](tbd)
- [Table Design](tbd)
- [PCB](tbd)
- [Reaction Time Game](tbd)
